# Swift Serve

This framework is not currently ready for public consumption. It needs true documentation.
I use it in several projects but I have not had the time to make the necessary changes for it to be accessible
to other developers.

It is a framework for developing server side swift websites and services. My goal in developing it was to provide
myself an abstraction that I can write all of my websites and web services against that allows me to switch between
other frameworks easily (e.g. Zewo and Kitura) without rewriting the application level code. The advantage for me
is that I wrote it exactly the way I want things to work. I am not sure I see the attraction for other developers
as they can just use Zewo, Kitura, or whatever directly. As it matures and if I see a reason it would be attractive
to other developers, I will certainly try to make it more accessible.

If anyone is seriously interested in using it I am happy to have a discussion and I could probably be convinced to
add some documentation.
